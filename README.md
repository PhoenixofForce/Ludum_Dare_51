# LDJam 51 Game

My entry for the [51st Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51). Made with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and SDL2_image in c++.

## Project Structure

You need to add the SDL2, SDL_image files (.dll, include and lib) yourself (maybe i will add them to a github release). 
```
mainFolder
- include
  - SDL2
- lib
- src
.gitgnore
Makefile
SDL2.dll
```
