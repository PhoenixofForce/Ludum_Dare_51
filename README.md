"Comp is too difficult" you say? Well, this game about a barber that chose to work in a subway station was made in just 10 Hours. You play as the SpeedBarber who chose the busy travellers of the subway as his customers. Because they are so busy, you have to finish their requests in 10 seconds or less.
